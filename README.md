We are a group of students in L3 MIAGE at the University Pantheon Sorbonne and as part of a university project in development, we develop a luxury travel reservation application in PHP 8 and Symfony using the ORM DOCTRINE.
We started this project on January 18, 2022, currently it can be put in production but we want to continue to improve it so that it is as we imagined. To do this, we would need some help with our database.

Here is our conceptual data model :
